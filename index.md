# Ham Radio Roadmap

This is just a dummy paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Essentials

*   2x Radios: Analog and DMR with Front End Programming, with Extra Batteries
*   1x Power Bank: at least 10,000mah
*   ...

## Ham Radio Terms

### Basic Terms

- **Frequency**: The number of cycles of a periodic wave that occur in one second, measured in Hertz (Hz). Different frequency bands are used for various purposes, such as amateur radio, FM radio, and television broadcasts.

- **Wavelength**: The physical length of one complete cycle of a periodic wave, typically measured in meters. Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency.

- **Modulation**: The process of encoding information onto a carrier wave for transmission. Common modulation techniques include amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation (PM).

### Frequency Bands

- **VHF (Very High Frequency)**: A frequency range from 30 MHz to 300 MHz, primarily used in ham radio for local communications.

- **UHF (Ultra High Frequency)**: A frequency range from 300 MHz to 3 GHz, used for various applications, including television broadcasting, mobile phones, and amateur radio.

- **HF (High Frequency)**: A frequency range from 3 MHz to 30 MHz, used in ham radio for long-distance communications, as signals can bounce off the Earth's ionosphere.

### Communication Modes

- **Single Sideband (SSB)**: A form of amplitude modulation (AM) that transmits only one sideband of the carrier wave, either upper sideband (USB) or lower sideband (LSB), reducing bandwidth and power requirements compared to traditional AM.

- **Morse Code (CW)**: A method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off signals, such as short (dot) and long (dash) signals. In ham radio, CW refers to continuous wave, which is the transmission of a continuous carrier wave modulated by the Morse code signal.

- **Digital Modes**: Various digital communication methods that use computer-generated signals to transmit information. Examples include FT8, PSK31, and RTTY.

### Advanced Concepts

- **Crossband**: The practice of using two different frequency bands for transmitting and receiving signals in a communication system, often with a dual-band radio.

- **Repeater**: An electronic device that receives a signal on one frequency and retransmits it on another frequency, usually with increased power and/or a better antenna, to extend the range of VHF and UHF communications.

- **Software-Defined Radio (SDR)**: A type of radio communication system that uses software to perform many functions traditionally implemented in hardware components, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability in radio systems.
